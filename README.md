V-BUILD is a web-based platform developed using PHP and MySQL to assist users in finding architects, real estate agents, and construction-related services in one place. 
The system allows users to search and connect with professionals, view architectural designs, panchayat-approved budgeted homes, and land details for sale. 
It provides features like user registration, booking, chat communication, ratings, and reviews for better decision-making. Administrators can manage users, companies, real estate agents, and monitor all activities. 
The project enhances transparency, accessibility, and convenience in building construction and real estate dealings, with a focus on scalability and user-friendly design.
